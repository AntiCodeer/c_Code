# c_Code
In this repo i have some c programs's

You Can Compile and run all this code's by using GCC Compiler.

- Step 1 :- Just Type ->  gcc programName.c -o programName
- Step 2 :- And Then -> ./programName

Thess are the Qn's and Description/Instruction to solve The problems
- ha_ass1.c :-
This is the first exercise of C programming tutorials. This C programming series contains many exercises that will help you to become a great problem solver. So, your first task is to “Print Multiplication Table in C”. All of the concept we have studied till now will use in this task, so by solving this exercise you can examine yourself that how much effort you need to put in learning C language.

Instructions:-
Take an input (in integer form) from the user and print its multiplication table on the screen. Following is the example of the output.

Input:
Enter the number you want multiplication table of: 6

Output:
Table of 6.

6*1 = 6

6*2 = 12

6*3 = 18

6*4 = 24

6*5 = 30

6*6 = 36

6*7 = 42

6*8 = 48

6*9 = 54

6*10 = 60

- ha_ass2.c :- 

Question : Write a program which converts the following units into another : 

In this program simply use switch case statements to ask user which type of conversion he wants to do and then simply use basic mathematics and convert one unit into another.

- ha_ass3.c :- 
Question : Write a program using recursive function to produce Fibonacci series of numbers?

-ha_ass4.c :-
The task you have to perform is “Star Pattern In C”. Printing different pattern is one of the most popular programming exercise for beginners, it not only improves the programming skills but also the thinking ability of the person. Following are the instructions you have to follow:

Instructions:-
Take input from the user and ask the user to choose 0 for the triangular star pattern and 1 for the reserved triangular star pattern. When the user entered the number, your program should print the pattern accordingly.

Hint: Ask the user to enter the number of rows and then use nested for loop to print rows and columns of triangular star pattern.

Triangular star pattern:
*
**
***
****

- ha_ass5.c :- 
The task you have to perform is “Array Reversal in C”.

Instruction:
In this task you have to write a C program that will reverse an array of integers. For that purpose, create the function that will take array as an argument and reverse an array.

Your program should print the array before and after reversal.

For Example:

Before Reversal: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 67

After Reversal: 67, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

- ha_ass6.c :-
While using a browser, when you click right and select view page source, you will see the HTML of that website you are using at that time. HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. So, today’s task is to write a code to “parse the sample HTML.”

Instructions:
You are given with an HTML code like, <h1> This is a heading </h1>.Your task is to parse the content written between the HTML tags. 

char string[] = "<h1> This is a heading </h1>";

For this task, you have to create a void function parser, which will take a string as an argument and return the parsed content written in the HTML code. Following is the sample of input and output.

Input:
<h1> This is the heading </h1> 

Output:
This is the heading

- ha_ass7.c :-
The purpose of the exercises given in this series is to help you become a pro in coding. The problem you are going to solve is very interesting. The task is to create a C Language program that works as a Travel Agency Manager.

Instructions:-
You manage a travel agency, and you want your n drivers to input their following details:

Name of the driver
Driving License Number
Route 
Kms
Your program should be able to take n as input (or you can take n=3 for simplicity), and your drivers will start inputting their details one by one. Your program should print details of the drivers in a beautiful fashion. For this task, you have to use Structure only. These four inputs: name, driving license number, route, and km information will be struct members. After creating struct, you have to create its array of size “n.” 

- ha_ass8.c :- 
Problem Statement:-
Suppose ABC is a private limited company which manages the employee records of other companies. Employee id can be of any length, and it can contain any character. The following are the task you have to perform for three employees.

Take the length of an employee id as an input and store it in an integer length variable
Take an employee id as an input and display it on the screen.
Save the employee id in a character array, which is allocated dynamically.
Create only one character array dynamically.
Program Example:-
Employee1;

Enter the no. of characters in your employee id: 45

//dynamically allocate the character array

Take input from the user: //employee_id

Employee2;

Enter the no. of characters in your employee id: 5

//dynamically allocate the character array

Take input from the user: //employee_id

Employee3;

Enter the no. of characters in your employee id: 9

//dynamically allocate the character array

Take input from the user: //employee_id

You have to reallocate the memory in such a way so that your program is robust and uses less memory. By solving this exercise, you will not only practically perform the concept we have learned until now, but also it will improve you coding skills. Try to develop problem-solving skills in yourself. This will help in becoming a pro in programming. Best of luck!
